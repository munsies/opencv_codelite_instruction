Instructions on how to add/use opencv libraries in codelite ubuntu 16.04 without using opencv.pc or pkg-config --libs --cflags opencv. Please see screenshots for suggestions

1. Locate libraries in your computer. Search for prefix with lib or suffix with .so/.so.x.x (version number)(inst_1.png),Include.hpp(inst_2.png)
2. In codelite, project and go to setting. (inst_3.png)
3. In compiler, copy and paste include path (inst_4.png)
4. In linker, at library search paths: copy and paste library path(inst_5.png)
5. In linker, at libraries: add iibraries those are needed for your project. (inst_6.png)

Note, extra steps were needed for libraries with version number. (inst_7.png)
1. Create file inside /etc/ld.so.conf.d/opencv.conf
2. In the file add path location of your opencv library.
3. After saving file run: ldconfig -v

After this step, I was able to use libraries with version numbers.
